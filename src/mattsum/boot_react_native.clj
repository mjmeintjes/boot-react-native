(deftask link-goog-deps
  "Parses Google Closure deps files, and creates a link in the output node_modules directory
   to each file.

   This makes it possible for the React Native packager to pick up the dependencies when building
   the JavaScript Bundle allowing us to develop with :optimizations :none.
   
   Explanation:
   In order for `:optimizations :none` to work (where cljs just spits out individual files),
   we have to let React Native know about those files. Luckily, RN packager picks up `goog.require`
   just like it picks up `require`. Unluckily, `goog.require` does not map to a specific file. Rather,
   Google Closure maps the module name provided in `goog.require` to a file name via mappings set up
   in deps.js files.
   
   Because we are short-circuiting `goog.require` in order to work with RN, we need to short-circuit
   the deps lookup as well. This task looks up the filename for each cljs module, and then renames
   that file (using the module name expected by `require`), and places the file in `node_modules`,
   because that is where React Native expects it to be."
